        <h1 style="color: #002147">Overview</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
          Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020, or nearly one in every six.<a href="#head4">[1]</a> Despite advancements in science revealing the complex interaction of variables responsible for malignant phenotypes,  successful treatments for most cancers are still a long way from reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traditional cancer treatments rapidly kill growing cancer cells and normal cells. This leads to many adverse effects or even death in some cases. Targeted drugs represent an improvement over traditional therapies but have several flaws; for example, antibody-drug conjugates often cause great side effects; pathway inhibitor drugs rely on specific pathways, which sometimes can be bypassed by tumour cells.<a href="#head4">[2]</a></p>
        <p>
          As we learned of all these issues, we were determined to find a means to aid the millions of people suffering from cancer and its harsh treatment side effects. We began by learning how cancer medicines function and tried to get to the bottom of the issue. It was immediately apparent that present drug delivery systems were severely inadequate due to their unaffordable costs and off-site targeting. Therefore, we chose to build a more robust, affordable drug delivery system with improved specificity and efficacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          A group of 15 enthusiastic research students formed a group to seek and tackle the challenge of offsite targeting by leveraging the ability of synthetic biology to synergistically combine different approaches in cancer therapy. We started working extensively towards this goal, and eventually, it led to the creation of <strong>DUONCO</strong>, a novel dual nanovesicle drug delivery system that we believe has the potential to reduce off-site targeting. We hope to establish a new system to drug delivery that can be improved and adapted to better serve the needs of patients. To our knowledge, this is the first time such a dual nanovesicle system has been designed for targeted therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our next objective was to select a suitable model for our project. We went through the literature on current statistics of cancer rates in India and found out that breast cancer has become the most prevalent form of cancer, with the highest gross incidence and mortality. A few of our members also attended a medical camp held in our community, where they learned about the dramatic increase in breast cancer cases and their lack of knowledge of the diagnosis, causes, and treatments. This motivated us to select breast cancer as our model disease and move toward developing our drug delivery system.
        </p>
        <p>
          As our project progressed, we engaged with oncologists, doctors, and drug delivery specialists to finalise the components of our prototype. Our project modelling proved to be incredibly useful for comprehending the dynamics of OMV internalisation and augmenting our wet lab. While speaking with non-governmental organisations (Hair for Hope, Knitted Knockers), we observed the lack of knowledge and stigmas around breast cancer. This motivated us to organise talks and a drama to raise awareness, a breast cancer screening camp, a hair donation campaign, awareness pamphlets, and other outreach events. We also conducted a survey via online and offline platforms to analyse the awareness of the general public on breast cancer and related topics. This gave us insights on people's misconceptions (males cannot get breast cancer, breast cancer can cause pregnancy issues), and we made it a point to ensure that all of these issues were covered while preparing our outreach initiatives. Our meeting with companies and the government startup commission helped to get perspective on how to further our concept, and enabled us to build a suitable plan to introduce Duonco to the public in the best manner.
          <a id="head2"></a>

        <br>

        <div>
          <h1  style="color: #002147">Our Approach</h1>
          <br>
          <p>
            When we started exploring more about our project, we felt it would be best to develop a framework to execute our IHP effectively. Each step was planned in a manner that would help in working out the one that followed it. Our team used this method to ensure that discussions and lessons learned from one project stage were carried over and incorporated into the next. This made it easier for us to ensure that <strong>DUONCO</strong> , as a drug delivery system, mirrored the values determined to be significant to our stakeholders.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The opinions of stakeholders, drug delivery experts, academia, cancer scientists, pharmaceutical companies, the general public, caretakers and doctors have all contributed significantly to determining the course of our project at each level of our human-centred, four-step approach to IHP.

              </p>
          </div>
          <br>


          <h2>Understanding the problem</h2>
          <p>
            As we began with our project we realised it was of utmost importance that we try to understand how large of a problem we are addressing? Who are the people this work would impact? What is currently being done to tackle the issue? What resources we can obtain for this?
          </p>
          <p>
            As a first stage for addressing these questions we took several measures being: Preparing survey to analyse the publics awareness on the subject, scouring through literature to gain a wider understanding of the severity of the issue and its significance in our society and talking to social scientists. These helped us identify our major stakeholders them being:
            <ul>
              <li>Patients</li>
              <li>Pharmaceutical companies</li>
              <li>oncologists</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            At the second stage of understanding our problem, we interacted with our major stakeholders. We held interviews with breast cancer survivors (interviewed 7 survivors) and doctors (4 doctors) about the cost, efficacy, efficiency and affordability of current targeted drugs. We spoke with pharma companies such as <a href="https://www.sanofi.in/">Sanofi Amentis</a> to understand the process, right from the start of funding research for medicines to each stage of trials, marketing strategies and legal procedures. We learned about the outlook of the general public towards genetic engineering and the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in medicine. From our interactions with professionals in the field of science communication, we developed an effective system for synthetic biology education.
            <a id="subhead2.2"></a>
          </p>
          <br>

          <h2>Ideate</h2>
          <p>
            Having identified and understood the multiple adverse aspects of the current cancer therapy problem, our team began brainstorming solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            After discussing and analysing our stakeholders' needs, we decided on a synthetic biology solution. These are all aimed at an effective mechanism to administer the medicine to tumour cells, while keeping other cells safe. It was also where current methods fell short due to their high cost, lack of specificity, and failure in providing a sustained immunogenic action.
          </p>
          <p>
            Key Points We Received From Our Stakeholders Are:
            <ol>
              <li>Financially affordable and economical access to cancer therapy</li>
              <li>A solution for offsite targeting</li>
              <li>Safe to environment</li>
              <li>Inform the public about synthetic biology and its application in therapeutics to debunk any stigmas associated with GMOs.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            We began to go through published literature and found E.coli outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) as an attractive candidate for our nanocarrier due to studies on its efficiency as a drug carrier in in-vivo experiments (Cite gujarati paper). We met with several experts in the field— Dr. Denice Bay, Dr. Gujarati, Prof. MRN Murty— and decided upon OMVs and the usage of a dual OMV system to enhance the specificity of the therapeutic.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            We finally chose our model to be breast cancer, realising its significance in our immediate locality from statistics and our firsthand interactions during UBA (UNNAT BHARAT ABHIYAN) medical camp. In Thiruvananthapuram, breast cancer had the highest incidence among all cancers and accounted for one-fourth of all new cancer cases in 2018-2019 (Annual Report 2018-19, RCC). All of this information cemented our desire to develop Duonco for use in breast cancer therapy.
            <a id="subhead2.3"></a>
          </p>
          <br>

          <h2>Define a Solution</h2>
          <p>
            To form a solution we continually met with our stakeholders and integrated their feedback throughout the design process and thus we made our efforts to ensure <strong>DUONCO</strong> holistically embodies the needs of everyone involved in our stakeholder chart.</p>
          <p>
            We corresponded with wet lab experts and our PIs to design the experiments required to build and test our system. We prepared a list of materials and budgeted. We came up with a project plan comprising of three phases:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Phase 1: </strong>Optimise OMV isolation</li>
              <li><strong>Phase 2: </strong>Isolation of engineered OMVs</li>
              <li><strong>Phase 3: </strong>Testing OMV internalization in a HER2+ breast cancer cell line</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the relatively short duration of the project, we chose to restrict our scope to generating engineered OMVs and testing their uptake. We attempted to supplement our experiments with results from math modelling, and vice-versa. Primarily, we used math modelling to obtain predictions for components or processes we were unable to experimentally achieve. This included electroporation to load the cargo into the OMVs and prodrug-enzyme interactions. We found a general correspondence between the results from math modelling and wet lab experiments, especially relating to protein expression. We parallelly planned awareness programmes and events to take our projects to people who really needed them
          </p>
          <p>
            Our final identified value was that the solution be financially viable and scalable, allowing realistic implementation of the solution. Synthetic biology lends itself well to being scalable, and has great potential to be a financially viable solution. Thus we made it a point to keep our four points from stakeholders during ideating to be the driving factor of our design for DUONCO.
            <a id="subhead2.4"></a>
          </p>
          <br>

          <h2>Evaluate and Execute</h2>
          <p>
            Having defined our problem, our project and our plans, we organised our team to effectively work towards our goals. We distributed tasks among team members. We set a timeline for our work and frequently discussed our progress with out PIs, who always provided us with feedback.
          </p>
          <p>
            We continued to meet with experts to better understand different wetlab techniques such as electron microscopy (to image OMVs) and dynamic light scattering (to characterize OMVs). We reached out to researchers who kindly contributed hypervesiculating E.coli strains, plasmid backbones and breast cancer cell lines SKBR3 and MCF-10A. We procured other materials such as antibodies and restriction enzymes in the form of sponsorship from companies. This set us up for for fruitful experiments in the lab.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our entire project, including our IHP journey, has been focused on people, and our proposed implementation is no different. Returning to our stakeholders and specialists throughout the implementation planning phase allowed us to close the loop and make decisions based on their values and needs in terms of ethics, technology, safety, and communication. Talking to the <strong>Kerala Startup Mission </strong>and drug delivery companies, we were able to devise a proper future plan to scale DUONCO to its next level.

          <br>
          <p>
            Understanding the impact of our project on the community, receiving the input from the stakeholders and establishing a feedback loop is a fundamental component of integrated human practices. To facilitate this loop we interacted with several individuals and organisationa throughout the course of the project.

          <h2>Motivation</h2>
          <br>
          <p>
            In 2020, the number of cancer cases rose to 19.3 million, while the number of deaths surpassed 10 million. Cancer reach is accordingly ever evolving to battle against this exponential rise in cases. Many of the existing therapies for cancer have significant side effects associated with them. In order to fully comprehend the limitations of the existing therapies, we interacted with patients and clinicians who could give us a first-hand account of their impact.

On International Women's Day 2021, some of our team members volunteered for a breast cancer screening camp in association with the UBA committee of our institute at a nearby village of Chathancode, Kerala. In 2020, breast cancer became the cancer with the highest gross incidence and mortality, both in India and worldwide. Even in our little community of Vithura (with a population of 20,000), the incidence of breast cancer patients was alarmingly high. This demonstrated the severity of this disease and the urgent need for a more effective treatment method. These statistics led us to choose breast cancer as a model to perform our study.UBA or Unnat Bharat Abhiyan is a central government initiative that enables higher education institutions to visit rural areas of India and bring in development in those areas.

          <br>
          <p>
            To better understand the side effects of current treatment methods, we spoke with a teacher who had cancer and has since recovered. She was 44 years old when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She was tested after discovering a lump in her breast. She recalls her treatment as a traumatic experience. She encountered difficulties during her chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She lost her hair and her body became weak. She also had lymphedema on her left hand as a result of having her left breast removed. She could not go to work for a long period of time. Talking to her helped us understand the desperate need for a treatment that can reduce the side effects. She was also willing to use the treatment method that uses genetically modified organisms, as long as these severe side effects are reduced. This ensured that people will be most willing to use therapeutics prepared using genetically modified organisms and hence we could proceed with a method using synthetic biology. This interaction also made us aware that lymphedema is a common condition for people who have undergone mastectomy. We decided to interact with respective stakeholders to get better understanding about mastectomy. In addition, we decided to meet more cancer survivors and have a better understanding of the frequent issues patients confront throughout treatment in order to address some of them through our project

          <h3>Survivor Interviews</h3>
          <h5>Hello</h5>
          <br>
          <p>
            The end users of our novel treatment method are the patients. Getting to know their difficulties and expectations is essential. Though cancer is widely spoken about, some aspects of cancer therapy including mental and physical frailty, societal pressure, and financial concerns are never under the spotlight. Therefore, we interviewed five individuals who had been cured of breast cancer. We obtained their permission prior to conducting our semi-structured interview. The consent form is attached <a href="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4359/wiki/human-practices/consent-survivor-interview.pdf">here.</a> Their perspectives on various breast cancer elements are described below.

We spoke with him to know about the current breast cancer statistics of Vithura Panchayat. But he was unable to help us in that matter. We also wanted to know of current programs by local and central government to increase detection tests for cancer. He connected us to Asha workers. ASHA workers are Accredited Social Health Activists. But we were unable to reach our to them.

          <p>
            To know about current treatment methods other than chemotherapy, we visited KIMS Health Centre in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. We met Dr Bharath V.M., the surgical oncologist at KIMS. He introduced us to Breast-conserving surgery (BCS), where only the lump with roots will be removed surgically. It is also known as lumpectomy. He pointed out that all patients cannot undergo BCS. Even the patients who have undergone BCS may need to go through other treatment methods later like radiation therapy, hormone therapy or chemotherapy. BCS can have side effects like pain, scar, dimples, or lymphedema in the arm. We understood that a better treatment method is essential. Then he discussed the gravity of HER2-positive breast cancer. It is a particularly aggressive form of breast cancer. Cancer comes in various forms. Each type of mutation is very different. The stage of HER2+ breast cancer is determined using a scoring method. The degree of HER2+ protein expression on the surface of breast cancer cells is indicated by immunohistochemistry scores ranging from 0 to 3. A score of 0 to 1+ indicates that it is HER2-positive. A score of 2+ indicates that the cells are borderline, while a score of 3+ indicates that they are HER2+.

Aside from her years of experience as a histopathologist, she and a few other doctors created the Brexa app. It assists people in detecting breast cancer early and directing further treatment. It is used by thousands of people all over the world. It instructs users on how to perform self-breast examinations. In our interaction with her, she went over our survey questions to ensure they were relevant. She emphasised that there are other types of breast cancer besides HER2 positive ones. Although there are fewer cases of other types, they are of high grade. Other types of breast cancer lack the receptors that our project targets. We decided to learn more about other types of breast cancer and potential targetable receptors. This will aid in the expansion of our project DUONCO to a wider range of cancer types. She discussed the issue of breast cancer detection in India, where people do not voluntarily undergo screening tests. We recognised the importance of raising awareness in our society. We planned a number of public awareness campaigns to help with early detection.

          <h3>Breast Cancer Awareness Survey</h3>
          <h5>Data Collection and Analysis</h5>
          <br>
          <p>
            Once the team decided to use the novel drug delivery system to target breast cancer, we felt it was critical to ascertain how well-informed the general public is about the disease and whether there are any myths that we can dispel. So, with the help of Dr Harilal Madhavan, we created a questionnaire and made sure we adhered to all the safety requirements for using human subjects in research. We made our survey available online in June 2022 in 5 different languages. We also collected print surveys from people that we believed we couldn't reach through online platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            We received over 300 responses for our survey and we particularly aimed at finding correlations between different parameters we asked in the questionnaire.
              <br>
              The suvey is linked <a href="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4359/wiki/human-practices/survey.pdf">here.</a>

          </p>
          <p>
          <h4>Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            Part A of the survey was designed to assess the general public's knowledge of breast cancer detection and other aspects. Part B contained statements that required the participant to determine whether they were myths or facts. The survey was filled out by people of all ages, genders, from different educational and professional backgrounds.
            <br>
            One of our questions was about what people thought about curing breast cancer, and most people thought it could be cured if caught early. We gave our participants a list of factors and asked them to identify the breast cancer risk factors among them. The majority of people were unaware of all of the risk factors. We further plotted the results to compare the responses based on occupation and education. It was discovered that respondents, regardless of profession, were unaware of the risk factors for breast cancer. In terms of education, however, graduates and postgraduates were more aware of risk factors than those who had only completed secondary or higher secondary school.

            Upon asking if the participants knew how to perform a self breast examination (SBE). Only about 45% of those surveyed were aware of the technique. We recognised that there was an urgent need to educate people about this. We also discovered that people working in academia were less aware of SBE than medical or other professionals. Although this cannot be stated explicitly because the sample size for people in the medical profession is relatively small.

          <h3>Public Interviews</h3>
          <h5>Hello</h5>
          <br>
          <p>
            As soon as we began defining our stakeholders, it became clear that the general public is the most significant stakeholder in our project. We therefore believed it was imperative to reach out to them and learn more about their perceptions of cancer and drug delivery mechanisms. Team members travelled to their home states—Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and New Delhi— and went out and spoke with people from various walks of life to get a general sense of how issues related to breast cancer are viewed. We obtained their permission before filming the interview. Consent form is available <a href="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4359/wiki/human-practices/consent-form-street-interviews.pdf">here.</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            These exchanges gave us a lot of new information, including the fact that:
            <ul>
              <li>Very few people were aware that men may develop breast cancer.</li>
              <li>Self-breast exams were not widely known.</li>
              <li>They were also unaware of the value of early diagnosis in treating the illness.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
              This served as our motivation for printing out informational pamphlets with essential breast cancer awareness information.

            Barbara Demorest is the founder of Knitted Knockers Support Foundation. She is also a breast cancer survivor. We interacted with her to know more about her journey as well as the need for the knitted knockers. She faced several difficulties during her treatment days, always felt that her mental health often took a backseat to her physical well being. Her not being able to have reconstruction surgery or use a synthetic prosthetic really held her back from going back to life. <a data-modal-target="#modal1" class="button">Read more</a>

                  Knitted Knockers was introduced to her through her doctor. Her friend later knitted knockers for her with the help of tutorial videos and finally she was able to gain a sense of freedom to go out, hug people and wear a normal bra without having to use any medical prosthetic device, this gave her a sense of normalcy. This was her inspiration to form KNITTED KNOCKERS. Several people who joined the initiative were able to relate to the shared trauma that they all faced.
                  <br><br>
                  First step towards forming this Non Profit Organisation was contacting her doctor and finding out the demand of knockers (50,000 mastectomies in a year - USA). Once the doctor gave them a number, the next step was to find resources in terms of the yarn and people to knit, so they could provide these knitted knockers for free. In 10 years, they've grown to having 1900 medical clinics registered with them and 60 international countries. Every month 10-12,000 knockers are being handed out. Her strategy for this was to raise awareness and get the local community there to involve and provide for their region. Knitters make the knockers and send it to their headquarters where they stuff them and post them to clinics.

          <p>
            By interacting with mastectomy survivors and Ms. Barbara Demorest, we learned that those who have undergone a mastectomy confront numerous challenges. They experience discomfort and may have postural issues. During our conversation with Dr Kavitha Ravi of Thiruvananthapuram Medical College, we learned that the Regional Cancer Centre (RCC) in Thiruvananthapuram provides post-mastectomy breast prostheses. We went there in order to learn more about this. It is managed by nurses who are responsible for the patients' well-being. We visited Ms Geethakumari D., the head of the nursing staff. She explained that utilising a prosthesis or undergoing breast reconstruction surgery is entirely up to the patient's discretion. However, after a mastectomy, most women prefer to use one of these alternatives because their confidence has been impacted. She stated that prostheses are more popular than breast reconstruction surgery because they are less invasive. Patients who require silicone breast prostheses are provided with them. It originates in Taiwan. It cannot be used immediately after surgery because the area near the chest is extremely painful and may become contaminated. This prosthesis is only usable two months following surgery.

            <br>
            <br>
            Our interactions with these doctors and cancer survivors reminded us that a more effective treatment strategy is necessary that utilises the currently existing therapy medication, which has been shown to be extremely beneficial but with significant side effects . We chose to design a delivery system that utilises not one, but two cancer cell specific cell surface receptors in order to improve the specificity of drug delivery and mitigate the side effects caused due to offsite targeting.

          <p>
            We designed our project so that the drug reaches its target cells while causing no harm to non-cancerous cells. However, we had several queries about the target molecules, the peptide that should be attached, the plasmid construct that should be used, and a cell line that is feasible for us and on which we could work. As a result, we interacted with experts in these fields to get their feedback.

            Prof Mathew is a professor at the National Centre for Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bangalore. In addition, he serves as a visiting professor at IISER Thiruvananthapuram. He assisted us with our mathematical modelling. He asked us to determine the drug concentration necessary to kill cancerous cells. This will assist us in determining how much prodrug or enzyme can be loaded onto OMVs. This allows further calculation of pore size. Kinetics plays an important role here. We planned to use a hydrophilic dye for research into internalisation. He suggested employing lipohilic dye. We realised that the use of lipohilic dye was a vastly superior alternative to the use of hydrophilic dye and decided to employ the former in our future laboratory work. His advice proved to be extremely beneficial.

          <p>
            We had apprehension about several steps in our project. We were unsure of the plasmid construct and the order in which linker and tag had to be placed. Our interaction with Dr Gujrati gave us a clear idea on the plasmid construct part. Dr Gujrati is Research Scientist and Consultant at the Institute for Biological and Medical Imaging, TUM Germany. He has great experience in various fields like drug discovery, non-clinical pharmacology, bioimaging, scientific writing, immune and regenerative therapy. After the discussion with Dr Gujrati he offered to provide us with the plasmid containing the genes for (Cly A-Myc-Affi) construct.Through this interaction we were able to learn that mutations of the msbB gene and tol-pal gene are not necessarily required as they won't considerably reduce the toxicity or increase yield respectively. Length of the linker and the order of linker and tag can be flexible and can be suited according to the requirements. Our doubts on electroporation were clarified using his paper. Through his meeting we were able to narrow down our wet-lab procedures more accurately.

          <br>
          <p>
            Dr Ferreira is the junior researcher at University of Minho. She is one of the authors of "Selection of a new peptide homing SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells". In this paper, they discovered a peptide, Pep-1, which selectively binds to the HER2+ breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3. Our meeting provided us with insights about the functioning of the peptide and its potential for us in a targeted delivery system like Duonco.
          </p>
          <p>
            For successful delivery of the THP-OMV to the cancer cell, binding of the THP is not sufficient. Subsequent internalisation is also necessary. No experiments were done at physiological temperatures with Pep-1, hence its behaviour with respect to internalisation were unknown. She suggested that since other THPs generally internalise following binding, it is likely that Pep-1 will as well. We discussed the difficulties associated with culturing the cell lines mentioned in the paper (MCF-10-2A and MCF-10A) and explored alternative cell lines that could be use to test Pep-1. From our discussion, HEK 293 emerged as an appealing alternative, given that it does not usually overexpress the target markers of Pep-1. Pep-1 contains cysteine at the C and N terminus. Dr. Ferreria helped us understand the role of these residues in the binding ability of the the peptide by conferring a loop structure to it. She also mentioned that she has been utilizing homing peptides for vesicle-based delivery, and that the requirement of a disulphide bond should not be an issue during protein expression in a bacterial system.

            Ms Monica P. is a PhD student at IISER Thiruvananthapuram, working under the supervision of Dr Natesh Ramanathan, Assistant Professor. Our DUONCO project focused on two receptors that are overexpressed in cancer cells. Affi-OMV focuses on HER2, a commonly targeted receptor, whereas THP-OMV focuses on CX3CR1. Given the time constraints, she suggested that the team prioritise THP-OMV because it is the most novel aspect of the project. She also provided us with numerous practical suggestions. We planned our wet lab work around her suggestion, focusing on THP- OMV synthesis.

          <p>
            We had several doubts regarding various aspects of math modelling including the right model of each system. We met with Prof. Apala Majumdar - University of Strathclyde, UK. She explained the independent and dependent variables in our model. She also asked us to achieve maximum mathematical precision in the argument. She also emphasised that there should be a logical flow of information and must have proper references. She suggested meeting Prof. Philip K. Maini from the Wolfson Centre for Mathematical Biology, Oxford University for getting more inputs in these aspects. Our interaction with Prof. Rajen Kumar Sinha from IIT Guwahati proved useful as he suggested modelling most of our project using transport equations and boundary problems. We also met with Prof. Daniele Boffi from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, KSA. Our meeting with Prof. Aektha Agarwal, IIM Indore made us look into other models that we could work with and connected us to Dr Harish Kumar from IIT Delhi.

          <p>
            With the need for our solutions validated and project design in progress, we then required guidance on a number of DUONCO's technical characteristics. We required assistance in selecting appropriate isolation mechanisms and epitope tags for detecting OMVs, as well as appropriate models for our project and a few other details. Our next aim was to find experts relevant to our project and gain their feedback.

            Dr Denice Bay is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases at the University of Manitoba. She worked with OMVs to understand their formation associated with cationic antimicrobials and its application to reduce antimicrobial resistance (AMR) infections. Interaction with Dr Denice helped us to optimise our OMV isolation protocol as her earlier work included isolating OMVs from bacteria. She advised us to follow centrifugation rather than ultra filtration as filters are expensive. As a result of her experience isolating OMV, she is certain that culture with antibiotics will not result in significant side effects. She recommended freezing the culture at -20°C. She even recommended the use of OmpA Antibody for OMV detection. Throughout our OMV isolation, her counsel was crucial. We were able to complete the task effectively.

          <h3>Dr. Rajendra Kurapati</h3>
          <h5>Assistant Professor, IISER Thiruvananthapuram</h5>
          <br>
          <p>
            We had several queries regarding drug delivery. We approached Dr Kurapati to clarify these aspects. Dr Rajendra Kurapati is the Assistant Professor in School of Chemistry at IISER Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. As non-biodegradable nanoparticles are now used in a variety of industries, he is developing useful biodegradable materials for biomedical purposes. He has worked before with nanoparticles and drug delivery. To confirm the isolation of OMV, he suggested performing dls or TEM. He introduced the possibility of other receptors, such as Folate receptor alpha, being present on epithelial cells and overexpressed in cancer cells. This helped us identify the other potential receptors that can be targeted with OMVs in the future, given that folate receptors are overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer cells. <a data-modal-target="#modal0" class="button">here</a>

                    During our conversation with Dr Kurapati, we inquired about clinical and preclinical trials as well as our future experimental plans. He provided information regarding the experiments we should conduct to standardise the concentration of OMVs and how to load the drugs into the vesicles. While loading the drug and enzyme into the vesicles, he stressed which factors (such as temperature, pH, salt content, etc.) must be taken into account .
                    <br><br>
                    He suggested using the MTT assay to determine the optimal drug concentration and assisted us with the protocol. The research papers he shared with us were invaluable for conducting MTT assay experiments and planning pre-clinical trials. It was his suggestion that prompted us to examine the cytotoxicity of OMVs and the effect of the drug on cells, which led us to consider utilising different OMV concentrations. It assisted us in determining the number of cells required for the MTT assay. He also recommended that we perform an LDH assay, which we were unable to do but will explore for future plans.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, he discussed Doxil, which greatly enhanced our understanding of the vesicle-based drug delivery systems that are already on the market. In order to reduce the LPS toxicity, he instructed us to compare our system to Doxil and to consider how different modifications of PEGylation applied to liposome-based delivery systems could be applied to our project.
                    <br><br>
                    He suggested that we use confocal to examine vesicle uptake by the breast cancer cell lines we have employed. He also suggested a few indicators to confirm the uptake.
                    <br><br>
                    For future directions of clinical trials, he suggested using the Bulb C mouse and other immunodeficient mouse models with xenografts to conduct various experiments with our dual OMV-based system. His suggestions assisted us in pursuing this path. He went on to discuss in-vivo drug efficacy studies and in-vivo drug trafficking studies. His insightful comments comparing the OMV uptake by various tissues to our tumours prompted us to conduct experiments involving similar studies.

He is currently the Distinguished Professor and AstraZeneca Chair at the Institute of Bioinformatics and Applied Biotechnology. Prof.Murty raised valid questions regarding the formation of OMV, its solubility, its contents, immune systems action mechanism against it and also the structural similarities of its HER2 target. Since we met him around the inception of our project, his suggestions were important in shaping it. It helped us to go further into our plan. He suggested on performing Cryo TEM for better visualisation of OMVs because heat from TEM can lead to membrane structure deformation.

          <p>
            We met Prof. Chakravortty for performing Cryo TEM as the facility was not available in our institute. She guided us to Dr. Somnath in IISc. Prof. Chakravortty is a renowned  microbiologist and a pathologist who works as a professor at Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. She was awarded National Bioscience Award for Career Development, one of the highest Science Award by Government of India. She suggested not using electroporation method for insertion of prodrug and enzyme as it will be difficult for the large molecules to get internalised. This does assist us in investigating other approaches for effective and rapid internalisation. We did a lot more reading to acquire better knowledge. She also brought up the topic of internalising enzymes in type2 OMV. She proposed substituting mRNA for enzymes and creating a prodrug-mRNA system. We also decided to read more on this and choose an efficient system. She suggested an alternative method to verify internalisation of the OMVs that did not involve the prodrug and enzyme. She proposed using small dye molecules as cargo to monitor internalisation. We were unable to conduct these experiments, but they provide a viable method for tracking the movement of OMVs after internalisation.
            <br>
            She guided us in various aspects of our project and became our external mentor.

          <h5>Suggestions for choosing the breast cancer cell line</h5>
          <br>
          <p>
            To study how OMV will be internalised into cancer cells, we decided to study on mammalian cell lines. But we were unsure on which cells to use and how to proceed. We interacted with experts working on these fields.
            <br>
            We met with Dr Ramray Bhat, Associate Professor at Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. He guided us on proper usage, viability and availability of different cell lines. In his opinion HMLE cell lines are better than MCF-10 A. It made us aware to look into other available cell lines and select cell lines for control experiments. To understand more on MCF-10A cell lines, we contacted Dr Medhavi Vishwakarma. She directed us to doctoral candidate Ms Sindhu M. She highlighted the difficulties while working with MCF-10 A. Reaching confluency might be delayed without the presence of cholera toxin in medium for MCF-10 A culturing. We then interacted with Dr Rakesh S. Laishram. He gave inputs on the quantification of OMVs and showed the possibility of using fluorophores for detection. After intense reading and contemplation keeping in mind the inputs from the people we interacted with, we chose the cell lines we will be working on with. We chose SK-BR-3 as the cancer cell line and HEK 293 as the cell line for performing experiments in control.

            We had planned outreach and communication initiatives. However, it was difficult to acquire the necessary funding for these endeavours. Prof. Suresh Das advised us on how to secure funding for our proposed study. His suggestion to prepare a detailed budget breakdown assisted us in prioritising items. We created a sample budget, which aided in the launch of our project.

          <h2>Reaching out to the community</h2>
          <br>
          <p>
            Not only did we want to connect with professionals in this field, but we also wanted to reach out to other people and explain our initiative. We desired their opinion to understand the social landscape on the premise of breast cancer and drug delivery. Knowing their expectations and level of awareness felt necessary to streamline our outreach activities and project design. We made our efforts to prepare the right questions and reach people from different strata of society. For this purpose we prepared an analysis survey, conducted public interviews, talked to doctors, met with NGOs (working towards breast cancer), technicians, prosthesis makers, caretakers,policy makers, local government body and several other stakeholders to get a clear picture.

          <h3>Interactions</h3>
          <h5>Housekeeping Staff at IISER TVM</h5>
          <p>
            We spoke with the housekeeping staff of our institute. Most of them came from nearby villages. We interacted with them to know of their level of awareness of breast cancer. To further know if they have undergone any detection tests earlier. Most of them were aware of cancer detection tests like mammograms, but none had undergone it. They were also aware that breast cancer may be associated with lump. But they were not sure on how to detect them properly. We henc arranged an awareness talk for them and they were eager to attend those. Some even got the opportunity to undergo breast cancer detection tests using iBreast screening. After the awareness session, we spoke with them to know their feedback on the talk. All of them found the talk useful. They were attending such an awareness talk for the first time. They even requested frequent checkups like this. To pass this on the self breast examination techniques to their family and friends, we provided them with pamphlets.

            Dr Hema Francis is the medical officer at IISER Thiruvananthapuram as well as the secretary of IMA (Indian Medical Association), Nedumangad. We conversed with her about the lack of knowledge and the rising incidence of breast cancer in our region. She has organised numerous screening camps in rural areas and proposed that we conduct a similar campaign on our campus. She helped in organising breast cancer screening camp in our institute. She also assisted us in contacting individuals for our other events, such as teaching students of nearby schools and contacting medical professionals.

            <h5 style="color:#002147">In association with Indian Medical Association</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
              Our team organised a successful Breast Cancer Screening campaign for our institution's female housekeeping staff. IMA (Indian Medical Association) and KIMS Health Centre, Thiruvananthapuram collaborated on the event. Dr. Hemalatha assisted in the organisation of this programme. Dr. Kavitha Ravi was the honoured guest during the event. She is an adjunct professor at Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram. <a data-modal-target="#modal2" class="button">Read more</a>

                  The examination was administered utilising the iBreast Exam. It was handled by four KIMS Health Center technicians. The iBreastExam is a portable gadget that detects breast abnormalities. It is not a confirming test, although it can detect anomalies. The one-day screening camp was attended by around 35 housekeeping staff members. Participants were between the ages of 35 and 50. Proper written consent was obtained from the participants, and the respective doctors signed an MoU. MoU is attached here. To assure complete safety, we emailed the iGEM headquarters about our programme and obtained their approval before conducting tests. It is our responsibility to ensure that no stakeholders or members of the public are affected in any way by our project. Therefore, all safety regulations were fulfilled prior to implementing any programmes, especially large-scale ones.
                  <br>
                  The participants discussed their testing experiences. Nearly all of them were receiving screening tests for the first time, demonstrating the inaccessibility of such testing for persons living in rural areas. 8 percent of individuals who were tested came back positive, which is an extremely high percentage. Since the iBreast Exam is not a confirmatory test, they were referred for a proper confirmatory test and further for treatment.

          <h3>Awareness Talk</h3>
          <h5>Conducted during the Breast Cancer Screening Camp</h5>
          <br>
          <p>
            We determined, through activities such as surveys and interviews with the public, that the public is unaware of breast cancer and how early detection and good knowledge can save thousands of lives. Lack of awareness prevented individuals from getting screened for breast cancer, resulting in late-stage diagnosis. Compared to early detection, the percentage of cancer patients who are cured is substantially lower when the disease is identified at a later stage. Consequently, we saw the need for awareness. We organised a campus-wide breast cancer awareness lecture for our institution's housekeeping staff. Dr. Hemalatha Goldwin, medical officer of IISER Thiruvananthapuram, delivered the lecture. So that the audience could comprehend, it was conducted in the native tongue (Malayalam). The discussion included breast cancer examination procedures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Approximately 80 staff members attended this presentation. It was regarded to be highly useful by the audience. They were delighted to be attending their first breast cancer awareness talk.

          <h3>Name of Technician</h3>
          <h5>iBreast Technician</h5>
          <br>
          <p>
            iBreast is a preliminary screening test for Breast Cancer. A few members of our team spoke with an iBreast technician to learn how people are scanned at camps, whether people are reluctant to be screened, what challenges they encounter during the procedure, and what limitations the technique has.
          </p>
          <p>
            iBreast is a preliminary screening test. For confirmation, mammogram or FNAC is required. The main aim of organising screenings is to reach middle-class household women who don't prioritise their health over their family and chores. The system involves a portable sensor and a Bluetooth connected screen to view the image of 1/16th of the area at a stretch. Gradually we scan the entire area in parts and complete the scan. If there are any lesions or lumps it will show a red colour as an indication. There are few situations where false positive cases are shown.  However, this method has proven quite helpful for screening a number of patients and assisting them in receiving an early diagnosis of their ailment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, she claimed that despite people's initial reluctance, after learning about cancer and the need for screening, they are prepared to undergo screening and to be kept informed of developments by the doctors.This was an inspiration for us to conduct a camp and spread awareness.

              The high percentage of positive iBreast Exam results indicated the prevalence of breast cancer. Our institute is nestled in the foothills of the western ghats, 40 kilometres from the main city of Thiruvananthapuram. People in the vicinity of our institute reside in rural areas and lack access to screening tools. Therefore, we decided to educate them on self-breast inspection techniques that can be undertaken in their homes. We distributed pamphlets on campus, in the neighbourhood near campus, and in our hometown. Brochures were available in English and three additional languages (Malayalam, Tamil,  and Hindi). Illustrations were utilised to emphasise the SBE (Self Breast Examination) approach. It was created so that people may easily comprehend and follow the instructions. Dr Hemalatha Goldwin verified it before distribution.

            <br>
            <p>
              We desired to increase the reach of our awareness campaigns. In addition to expanding the programme, our goal was to reach people of all ages and genders with our message. We decided to stage a play in public. We in collaboration with the Theatrics society of IISER Thiruvananthapuram performed a play to the public in one of the busiest malls of Thiruvananthapuram city - Mall of Travancore.  Team members and drama club members collaborated to create a play about the significance of early breast cancer screening. In the drama, a housewife discovers that the lump on her breast may be breast cancer after watching television awareness programmes. Her examination results indicate that she has breast cancer. A few months of treatment were enough to eradicate cancer. It disseminates the idea that cancer screening tests are available and can save lives when used appropriately. We also described how to diagnose breast cancer through our play. The audience considered our performance to be beneficial and appreciated our efforts. In addition, we presented them with leaflets that explained breast cancer detection in depth.

          <h3>Premi Mathew</h3>
          <h5>Founder and CEO of Hair for Hope India</h5>
          <br>
          <p>
            Premi Mathew is the founder and CEO of Hair for Hope India and Protect your mom. She has survived breast cancer. She initiated the Protect Your Mom (PYM) campaign to emphasise the significance of breast cancer screening at an early stage. In this show, she aims to convey this message to children, through whom their mothers are informed. The mission of Hair for Hope India is to donate hair to cancer patients who have lost their hair as a result of chemotherapy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through our interactions with breast cancer survivors, we learned that although hair loss does not cause discomfort, it can have a significant impact on a patient's self-esteem. Additionally, it influences how others treat them. It is widely known that one of the negative effects of chemotherapy is hair loss. Thus, we visited with Premi Mathew and learned more about her business and her fight against cancer. She has encountered obstacles during her treatment. She was aware of the significance of early detection. To support her wonderful cause, we chose to cooperate with Hair for Hope India and the Protect your Mom campaign. We distributed posters conveying the PYM message.

            <h3>Hair Donation Campaign</h3>
            <h5>In association with Hair for Hope, India</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
              Our meeting with Premi Mathew prompted us to organise a campus-wide hair donation drive. The least we can do for cancer patients is to donate their hair. It is crucial because throughout cancer therapy, patients may get unwell and weak. Additionally, losing hair and being criticised by society are difficult to manage. Using wigs to restore their confidence might be of tremendous assistance. Approximately twenty ponytails of hair would be needed to create a wig. Therefore, as many individuals as possible should donate their hair. On August 15th, we held a hair donation event in partnership with the non-profit Hair for Hope India. We send information regarding hair donation in advance to students and faculty at our institution. Throughout the campaign, several students donated their hair. We obtained a written <a href="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4359/wiki/safety/hair-donation-mou.pdf">MoU (Memorandum of Understanding)</a> from the CEO of the non-profit organisation to prevent any misuse of the donated hair. Only willing individuals with the minimum needed length donated their hair. We got <a href="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4359/wiki/safety/consent-form-hair-donation.pdf">consent</a> from them before donating hair. We presented the donors with bookmarks as a token of our appreciation. It underscored the significance of their actions. We also informed them about the PYM (Protect Your Mom) Campaign and how early breast cancer screening can save lives. We packaged the hair and shipped the package to the Amala medical college in Thrissur, where the donated hair will be transformed into wigs for cancer sufferers.

So on World Cancer Day (February 4, 2022), we used a fun interactive mystery question to disclose the project's theme, and students could guess it by filling out a Google Form. To promote our initiative, we also placed posters throughout the campus and had a selfie competition with the poster. <a data-modal-target="#modal3" class="button">Read More</a>.

                  After much anticipation, on May 16, 2022, we formally introduced our project concept and team to the faculty, staff, and students of our institute. To a group of more than 100 people, each team member introduced themselves and talked about the project and its different subteams. During the event, we also unveiled OMIVON, our team mascot.

                  With the help of the <a href="https://www.mentimeter.com/">Mentimeter website</a>, which incorporates user ideas, we got to learn which social media platforms the audience prefers and how they view synthetic biology. Later, we planned and designed our human practices and outreach initiatives using these inputs. The previous iGEM team from our university also gave a speech about how iGEM had aided their development over the previous year. Additionally, we were able to get a lot of feedback from the audience, which was helpful for the project.

            Dr Shantala is a neuroscientist as well as a science administrator who works as an Associate Director in IndiaBioscience. She is a passionate researcher who is also interested in scientific communication. We had questions regarding how to advance the research and communication components of our project. She provided strategies for communicating synbio to non-STEM audiences. She encouraged students to take classes in synthetic biology, as they are the next generation and synthetic biology is a booming subject. We had a list of events planned for the outreach portion of our mission. She instructed to prioritise the most crucial items and implement them after appropriate planning. After speaking with her, we devised a methodical plan for the outreach initiatives. We decided to offer synbio lessons to schoolchildren. Her advice to focus on school students proved useful, as the questions posed by students throughout our interactions with them expanded our creativity even more.

          <h5>Talk series adressing women's issues</h5>
          <br>
          <p>
            Our team along with other iGEM teams from India conducted a talk series ‘We-Talk’ by eminent speakers. Talks highlighted various issues faced by women. Speakers of our talk series included Dr Manjiri Bakre (CEO and Founder of OncoStem Diagnostics), Dr Indira Palo (Gynaecologist & Obstetrician Doctor) and Dr Prerna Lakhwani (Senior Gynecologic Oncologist). Among the topics covered were Menstrual Hygiene, Adolescent Challenges, Cervical Cancer, and Breast Cancer. Their presentations on these topics enlightened the audience and proved useful. Students from different colleges attended the talk. The interactive sessions at the end of each session were very beneficial. At the conclusion of the three-day lecture series, a panel discussion took place. Each team's collaborators participated and discussed the issues women face.

          <h3>Track Your Waste</h3>
          <h5>Documentary on waste disposal systems</h5>
          <br>
          <p>
            As our project wetlab progressed , we felt it essential for us to acknowledge the biowaste we generate and ensure proper and secure disposal of the bio wastes that are produced in our laboratories. The fact that our campus is located in the Western Ghats makes it all the more important that we pay attention to how we handle the disposal of biological waste. We conducted in-depth research as well as a number of interviews with individuals who are involved in the biowaste management system.
            <br>
            It all started with a tip to the red coloured bin and the curiosity to know why different coloured bins and what is the waste of these wastes.

            <br>
            Thus we were able to establish an empathetic dialogue with our stakeholders. We were able to contribute to the cancer survivors from hair donation campaign, we helped the housekeeping staff at our institute get access to screening and awareness talk, we were able to educate people about breast cancer through our drama, pamphlet, project reveal and other meetups. In short we were able to achieve what we had aimed, and that is to resolve the disconnect between science and society.

          <h2>Project Safety</h2>
          <br>
          <p>
            Safety has been an integral part of our project from the very beginning. To ensure we did our part in safety we interacted with few people and also did a thorough literature review to learn the safety rules and law governing the usage of genetically modified organisms. We were thus able to adopt valuable feedback and prepare consents and get the concerned approvals for our work.

                      <li>We also gained some valuable suggestion that certain substitution mutations could be made to attenuate ClyA and it could effectively prevent its toxicity by inhibiting oligomerization.He suggested us the mutation to attenuate ClyA Mutation: The Y178F mutation in the cholesterol binding motif of the beta-tongue of ClyA prevents oligomerization into a pore-forming complex and hinders the pore forming ability on mammalian cell membranes. </li>

            IMAGE is the abbreviation for Indian Medical Association Goes Eco-friendly. The initiative was initiated by the Indian medical association. It has an effective method for treating biowaste. The waste generated by hospitals and laboratories is collected, transported, and separated into various categories. It is divided primarily into four colours: red, yellow, blue, and white. After proper separation, these wastes are treated differently based on their type. Some are passed through hot furnaces and made into ashes. Some are recycled. To better comprehend these, we travelled to the IMAGE Plant in Palakkad, a district in Kerala. The facility was equipped with extensive facilities for treating various types of bio waste. We created a documentary to inform the public about IMAGE.

            <br>
            We meticulously researched the present legislation and regulations set by the Ministry of Science and Technology's Department of Biotechnology (DBT). The DBT supports and oversees biotechnology development, as well as establishes guidelines for safe practises and laws for managing genetic engineering in India. Their Biosafety Research Programme emphasises the implementation of biosafety procedures, rules, and guidelines under the Environment (Protection) Act 1986 and Rules 1989 to ensure user and environmental safety from the use of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) and products thereof in research and application. The programme mandated a two-tier process consisting of Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBSC) at the Institute/company and the Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation (RCGM) in the Department of Biotechnology. As a result, we were able to obtain the necessary instructions from their online resources and apply for IBSC and RCGM approval.

            We met with Dr. Ramray Bhat, Associate Professor at Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. He guided us on proper usage, viability and availability of different cell lines. According to his opinion HMLE cell lines are better than MCF10 A. It made us aware to look into other available cell lines and  select cell lines for control experiments. To understand more on MCF10A cell lines, we contacted Dr. Medhavi Vishwakarma. She directed us to doctoral candidate Ms. Sindhu M. She highlighted the difficulties while working with MCF10 A. Reaching confluency might be delayed without the presence of cholera toxin in medium for MCF10 A culturing. We then interacted with Dr. Rakesh S. Laishram. He gave inputs on the quantification of OMVs and showed the possibility of using fluorophores for detection.

          <h5>Assitant Professor, RCC Thiruvananthapuram</h5>
          <br>
          <p>
            Dr. Rona is the Assistant Professor at the department of oncology at RCC (Regional Cancer Centre). After completing her M.B.B.S., she earned her M.D. and D.M. from prestigious institutions. She discussed the adverse effects of chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic treatments during our meeting. She urged us to continue developing our project. She then informed us of the other available targeted therapy. Already available are therapies that target antibodies. T-DM1 is an FDA-approved, effective drug for treating HER2-positive breast cancer. In addition, GMO-based pharmaceuticals are also available. Although all of these medications are available on the market, none of them are ideal. She discussed one of the side effects of antibody-directed therapy. Resistance development was a major drawback of this method. To determine whether our treatment has similar side effects, it must undergo clinical trials. She emphasised the fact that during clinical trials, the majority of drugs are typically rejected, and that only after multiple stages of testing can the efficacy of a particular treatment be confirmed.

                      <li>The initial step is preclinical lab work, and if a product is approved and appropriate, it goes to Phase one, two, three trials. Following that a  country-specific  local trial is required in some places while others only require Phase 3 regulations. Most countries agree to launch with an assurance of PMS (post-market surveillance). Few countries  also proceed to test real-world efficacy (RWE). </li>
                      <li>The second step includes the evaluation of : markets, population classifications, and paying capability. Modern medical treatment should combine safety, adherence, quality of life, targeted delivery, and other factors for effective therapy. Government approval is also necessary. NICE (The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, UK) reviews treatment reimbursement based on HTA (health technology assessment) standards. Market prices are set using International Reference Pricing.</li>
                      <li>Step three includes commercialising, conceptualising, engaging, and consumer understanding. Some corporations start an early access programme that requires special approvals from the host country, resulting in customer experience and a good advisory board by product launch.</li>

            We had questions about how to proceed with our project in the future, and we learned that cost we fix will vary depending on whether the project is in its early phases and whether it requires a licence or a proof of concept.We didn't see how a drug delivery system would be different. She enumerated the pros and cons. Bioequivalence tests are needed. Using an existing medicine increases safety, but we must first pass an inferiority trial. But this would reduce failures in phase one, two, three trials.She also discussed how a delivery system IP patent can be obtained if the conceptualization can be proven. She advised us to refer to CDSCO, Drugs and cosmetics act under DCGI. The act requires clinical trial phase three in the intended country or a waiver promising phase four. We were also introduced to a commercially available nanoparticle-based targeted delivery method, Abraxane, to refer more and develop our future direction.

            Safety has been an integral part of our project from the very beginning. To ensure we did our part in safety we interacted with few people and also did a thorough literature review to learn the safety rules and law governing the usage of genetically modified organisms. We were thus able to adopt valuable feedback and prepare consents and get the concerned approvals for our work.

              <br><br>
              The high percentage of positive iBreast Exam results indicated the prevalence of breast cancer. Our institute is nestled in the foothills of the western ghats, 40 kilometres from the main city of Thiruvananthapuram. People in the vicinity of our institute reside in rural areas and lack access to screening tools. Therefore, we decided to educate them on self-breast inspection techniques that can be undertaken in their homes. We distributed pamphlets on campus, in the neighbourhood near campus, and in our hometown. Brochures were available in English and three additional languages (Malayalam, Tamil, and Hindi). Illustrations were utilised to emphasise the SBE (Self Breast Examination) approach. It was created so that people may easily comprehend and follow the instructions. Dr. Hemalatha Goldwin verified it before to distribution.

          <h5>In collaboration with the Drama Club of IISER TVM</h5>
          <br>
          <p>
            We desired to increase the reach of our awareness campaigns. In addition to expanding the programme, our goal was to reach people of all ages and genders with our message. We decided to stage a play in public. We in collaboration with the Theatrics society of IISER Thiruvananthapuram performed a play to the public in one of the busiest mall of Thiruvananthapuram city - Mall of Travancore.  Team members and drama club members collaborated to create a play about the significance of early breast cancer screening. In the drama, a housewife discovers that the lump on her breast may be breast cancer after watching television awareness programmes. Her examination results indicate that she has breast cancer. A few months of treatment were enough to eradicate cancer. It disseminates the idea that cancer screening tests are available and can save lives when used appropriately. We also described how to diagnose breast cancer through our play. The audience considered our performance to be beneficial and appreciates our efforts. In addition, we presented them with leaflets that explained breast cancer detection in depth.

              Ms. Varsha Jaisimha is a former member of the IISER Pune iGEM team and also participated in After iGEM for a year. She is currently a member of the iGEM Foundation's engineering committee. She is accustomed to presenting iGEM work to a variety of audiences. We sought her since we were uncertain of how to present at Jamboree. She provided recommendations for the poster and the presentation. Even while we included human practices into other aspects of our project, such as the wetlab and drylab, this may not have been adequately communicated during the presentation. During presentations, she urged us to make a special effort to highlight our collaborative efforts. Presentations require effective time management. Within the presentation time provided, the project must be presented effectively. During our presentation, we will be sure to address these concerns. We later attended Ms. Varsha's presentation at the All India iGEM Meet.

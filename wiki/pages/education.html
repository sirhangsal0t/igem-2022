          <p>
            In order to educate the public about science in general and synthetic biology, we have utilised a variety of educational approaches. Our primary target audience was the next generation of bright thinkers who would benefit greatly from hearing about the exciting developments taking place in the rapidly developing synbio field.
          </p>
          <p>
            We conducted camps and sessions for a variety of classes, during which we discussed synthetic biology's tools and applications with the students. In order to make education more accessible to a wider range of people, we constructed our very own mobile classroom in the form of an educational van and drove it to the nearby school. We also have developed a number of new and innovative educational tools, such as a short handbook that explains the fundamentals of synbio and card games that turn synthetic biology into an enjoyable pastime.
          </p>
          <p>
            iGEM is a competition that uses synthetic biology to solve problems in the real world. Due to the fact that we are working on a project about breast cancer, we have been entrusted with the responsibility of enlightening the general public about the factors that put them at risk for developing breast cancer and providing any other relevant information. In order to raise awareness about breast cancer among the audience, we developed a pamphlet that was gender-neutral and available in multiple languages, and we also hosted an awareness session at our organisation. Through the public interview series as well as the breast cancer awareness drama, we were able to dispel the myths surrounding breast cancer for people of varying ages, genders, and other demographics

            <h2>Online SCI-BIO Camp</h2>
            <h5>Age range: 9-10 years</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
              Since children in the age range 9 to 12 years are just beginning to learn various science disciplines and are most curious to know more about it. Hence we believe this is an ideal time to plant the seeds of scientific temperament in them. In May, our team organised an online SCI-BIO Camp for students of this age. After analysing the curriculum and surveying students, the team methodically prepared the topics to be covered. The registration form gave us an idea of their familiarity with the topic before attending the sessions.

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
              A total of four three-hour sessions were held over the course of two days. The lessons were delivered by members of our team, and after each topic was discussed, students participated in an interactive activity designed to keep their attention and spark further discussion. One advantage of holding science camp online is that it removes geographical barriers and allows students from all over the world to participate. We believe that everyone, regardless of age, deserves the chance to gain knowledge. And hence, live streamed our entire two days camp for people of all ages to attend the sessions.

                  Around 30 enthusiastic participants were present in our camp. After learning the fundamentals of genetics, such as what a cell is, the different types of microbes, and the basics of synthetic biology, the kids participated in a session called "What superpower your microbe will have?" during which they were challenged to use what they had learned to devise their own solutions to real-world problems. On World Microbiome Day, we shared their works across our Instagram story. Click here to see the stories.

                  <br>
                  The participants were very appreciative of the event and the way it was organised, which served to introduce them to science and synthetic biology through lively discussions. They mentioned feeling at ease in the event compared to classroom classes and gave feedback that our novel approach to introducing the fundamentals sparked a surge in curiosity and prompted the further inquiry.

            <h2>“What does it take to be a Scientist?”</h2>
            <h5>Class 9 students (freshman year)</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
              After completing the online SCI-BIO Camp, we had an opportunity to interact with students of class 9 from Vidya Mandir Senior Secondary School, Chennai. It was an interactive session where the nuances of experimental design and hypothesis testing were showcased. Key concepts such as null and alternative hypotheses, setting up controls, and comparing experimental results were taught to the students.They were then asked to design experiments to try and disprove a simple hypothesis of “Number of insects attracted to the colour yellow would be the same as the number of insects attracted to the colour blue”. In addition, we asked them to come up with their own hypothesis and encouraged them to think creatively outside the box. We summed it up with a short introduction to what synthetic biology is and the potential that it has to formulate solutions to real-world problems, as well as our experience as young researchers.  The session provided a glimpse into the potential of a career in research and the limitless ways in which science can affect the world.

            <h2>Genetic Engineering Session</h2>
            <h5>Class 10 students (sophmore year)</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
              After completing the online SCI-BIO Camp, the next students who were going to be the focus of our attention were Class 10 students who very soon have to choose either a STEM or non-STEM course for higher studies. One of our team members led an interesting session with tenth graders at Brindavan Vidyalaya, Trichy, Tamil Nadu. The session centred around the fundamentals of genetics, the distinction between genetic engineering and synthetic biology, as well as a brief overview of a variety of different igem projects, which was followed by an explanation of the concept behind our own project, Duonco. <a data-modal-target="#modal2" class="button">Read more</a>.

                    Students were given engaging worksheets to complete during the session, and were given tasks to complete on the worksheets as the concepts were introduced and discussed. Through this session we were able to analyse the topics in which the students were most interested in. The students were most interested in learning about vaccines and the development of cancer cells.
                    <br>
                    To help them better understand the breadth of career options available to them after completing the 10th grade, these events provided a brief overview of every STEM and non-STEM jobs in India. The session was so engaging that we also discussed topics out of the scope of the session.  As requested by the students, the session slides were revised to include information on topics that piqued their interest during class and sent to them.

              Through this session, we realised the need for an self explanatory educational book that could introduce the field of synthetic biology, its applications, and information about pioneers in the field. As a result, we created "Introduction to Synthetic Biology" an information booklet designed to introduce high school students to the field of synthetic biology,  its applications, and information about pioneers in the field. Please refer to the <a href="">"Educational Materials"</a> section for any further details.

            <h2>Synbio on Wheels</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
              After conducting online sessions, we gained an understanding of the insatiable desire that students have to experience and do things by themselves. During the online microscope session, there was a great sense of excitement among the students. Because of this, we decided to take our initiative to reach out to more people by creating our very own Synbio on Wheels, which is a mobile education van equipped with microscopes. Six people from the team visited the nearby residential Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya School in Vithura with our mobile lab. We got the chance to talk to students in classes ranging from sixth to twelfth who were very enthusiastic about learning more about why we were there.
              <br>
              <br>
              We started off our visit by giving a brief classroom-based introduction to synthetic biology, iGEM, and providing an overview of our project. Later, the students were introduced to microscopes and shown a variety of microscopic organisms using prepared slides showing onion cells, E coli colonies, red blood cells, and the process of mitosis. We also introduced basic techniques of pipetting and LB plates used for bacterial culture. <a data-modal-target="#modal3" class="button">Read More</a>.

                <div class="modal-body text-justify">
                  <p>
                    The students were guided then to our van, where we had put various informational charts explaining different topics. It included cells, DNA, virus, vaccines, cancer, GMO (genetically modified organisms) and our project. The interior of our van was outfitted with a photocopy of microscopic images of lactobacillus, amoeba, onion cells, streaking and plating, fluorescently labelled cells, and two different kinds of microscopes. In addition, we screened an animation video inside of our mobile van that provided insights on the diverse range of microorganisms around us. At the gas station, where we stopped on the way back, we also had the chance to engage in conversation with members of the general public who lacked any scientific training. The information contained in the charts piqued their interest in learning more about cancer and vaccines.
                    <br>
                    Our main target students were high school juniors and seniors. But even elementary school students were eager to learn more about synthetic biology. The students were extremely inquisitive about everything that was discussed with them. When we finished our sessions, the teachers and students gave us very positive feedback. To find out what the students thought of the activity, we put up a comment board in our van. The enthusiastic responses we received gave us confidence that we had achieved our goal of educating them and have done justice to this initiative of Synbio on Wheels.

            <br>
            <p>
              Following our sessions with budding school students, next we shift our focus to STEM-focused students and researchers. This year, we present Synbio Conclave 2.0, a continuation of the global, virtual public talk series on synthetic biology and its applications that was initiated by our previous igem team 2022. We aim to bring together experts on current trends and techniques in this interdisciplinary field to foster a sense of inquisitiveness among the audience and to collectively appreciate the beauty of synthetic biology. All of our guest speakers possessed a common interest in synthetic biology, despite coming from very different fields of expertise. A four-day virtual event, from September 16th to 19th, 2022, was conducted with an amazing itinerary of talks by 5 outstanding scientists from across the world to expand the horizon of young, aspiring, scientific minds. Please find the itinerary for all the six talks of the conclave.

            <h2>Biosafety Education</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
              As researchers, it is essential for us to be knowledgeable about the proper and secure disposal of the bio-wastes that are produced in our laboratories. The fact that our campus is located in the Western Ghats makes it all the more important that we pay attention to how we handle the disposal of biological waste. After in-depth research as well as a number of interviews with individuals who are involved in the biowaste management system, we created a short documentary film, “Track you Biowaste”, which educates our institute community on how the biowaste that they generate in the lab are safely disposed outside the campus. The documentary was well received, and people were really amazed at the existence of such a waste management facility dedicated to biomedical waste in our state.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also uploaded our documentary film on social media handles to show people our approach to this journey of validating the biosafety aspect of our Wet Lab practices and educating people about further processing required for safe biowaste management. our documentation involved inputs from all the staff on and outside campus responsible for safe biowaste management so that the general audience will get to understand the involvement of so many hands behind the biowaste segregation and disposal.

            Stories with gripping visuals and good punchlines and stories that make intuitive sense, that make sensual sense to your eyes, and to your ears, and to your touch, they can convince, they have power. You may not believe that two balls, one heavy and one light, dropped from the same high place will drop together, but if you see it with your own eyes, THAT you remember. And as science gets harder, the metaphor becomes more useful and even necessary.

            <h2>WHY? - Sci Card Game</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
              Have you ever wondered why fireflies glow or why flowers bloom? Such curious questions are what has led to the unravelling of mysteries of science by scientists who are by heart still that little kid that wonders WHY it happened. And hence we present WHY? Science-based card game aims to unravel the mysteries of phenomena around us in a fun picture-based card activity. With our partner team, iGEM IISER Berhampur, we came up with questions that would raise curiosity in kids and urge them to think beyond the box about the things that they see around them every day.
            </p>
            <p>
              The moderator has a set of 10 cards. The kids have to pick one card from it, flip and read the question below the given picture. If the kid answers all the questions correctly in the cards, the kid will get a prize. In this way, we unravel the scientific facts in a very exciting way.

            <h2>Monopoly - Synbio Edition</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
              Board games aren't new to Indian kids. Snakes and ladders, Ludo, LIFE, Monopoly (or sometimes called business) were popular childhood pastime activities. Everyone can relate to the experience of staying inside on a hot summer afternoon to play Monopoly, stubbornly sticking with the same game for days, and eventually learning the ins and outs of business and finance. It's a fun, competitive game that teaches you not only about trading and investing, but also about patience and running a business.
            </p>
            <p>
              The fact that Monopoly is readily available, already well-known, simple to understand and play, and, most importantly, an excellent teaching medium are a few of the factors that contributed to our decision to use this game as a means to educate students about synthetic biology. Because of this, here we present MONOPOLY - SYBIO Edition. The target audience should be at least 12 years old to properly appreciate it.
            </p>
            <p>
              In our take on monopoly, the "players" are bacteria of various types, and the goal is to infect as many human organs as possible while staying alive in the game, where rent is paid in the form of protein units. The game is based on and played in a very similar fashion to the classic version of Monopoly, with the goal of learning how microbial infection in the human body works. The board has 20 cards representing different human organs, each with a brief description of the organ's location and function in the body. This helps pinpoint the organ's precise location inside the human body.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, the signalling cards, highlights of the game, serve as a set of instructions for the players, outlining various scenarios and the results they would have on the bacteria. Here, we hope to introduce synthetic biology by demystifying terms like plasmid, antibiotic resistance, chemotoxicity, and mutagens and giving players a taste of the changes observed in bacteria when exposed to modifications. The materials for this game are available <a data-modal-target="#modal8" class="button">here</a>.

            <h2>Information Pamphlets</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
              During our project reveal, we realized that there is very less awareness among students and the general public about Breast cancer. We might all, as students must, have learned cancer as a science term. But it is important for us to have a basic knowledge of cancer, the risk factor and how we can detect it early for better treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hence we talked to our institute medical officer Dr Hema Francis who has organized many breast cancer screening campaigns to create a Breast cancer awareness pamphlet to spread awareness to a wide range of audiences. Our pamphlet became a compact but effective educational tool to spread awareness about breast cancer. It takes a short time to read the pamphlet, and it acts as alarming information to teach and constantly reminds readers of the importance of Self Breast Examination for early detection. <a data-modal-target="#modal9" class="button">Read more</a>.
            </p>
            <div class="modal2" id="modal9">
              <div class="modal-header">
                <div class="title">Inforrmation Pamphlets</div>

              <div class="modal-body text-justify">
                <p>
                  The information for the pamphlet was created after consultation with Dr Hema Francis. Currently, there are two things that need to be urgently addressed to the public that is available in our pamphlets.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Create awareness about cancer itself and the potential risk factors</li>
                    <li>Instruction for Self Breast examination, a way for early detection.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                  We tried to make our pamphlet as inclusive as possible. Two things we incorporated were:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Breast cancer affects not just women but also men. We tried to make this pamphlet as much both gender targeted as possible.</li>
                    <li>Furthermore, we broadened our audience by consulting Mazhavil, the queer community of our institute, to make a gender-neutral Breast Cancer pamphlet.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The information pamphlet can be found <a href="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4359/wiki/education/pamphlet-english.pdf">here.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Later, we went to translate the pamphlet into <a href="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4359/wiki/education/pamphlet-malayalam.pdf">Malayalam</a>, our native language, <a href="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4359/wiki/education/pamphlet-hindi.pdf">Hindi</a>, the widely used Indian language and <a href="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4359/wiki/education/pamphlet-tamil.pdf">Tamil,</a> the neighbouring state language. All these translations were proofread and distributed to different people in different states according to their language preferences.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our pamphlet was extensively distributed during three of our important events - Breast Cancer Awareness Session, Breast Cancer Awareness drama and Public Interview series to break many myths about breast cancer to the general public.
                  <br><br>
                  We did not restrict our distribution only during events. All of our members made an attempt to distribute the pamphlet to whoever they met to spread this awareness. Some of the receivers include students, Doctors, Shopkeepers, Drivers, and Government workers

            <br>
            <p>
              As part of this campaign, We organised a Breast Cancer Awareness and Screening Camp for all the housekeeping staff of our institute. Our institute medical officer Dr Hema Francis conducted Breast Cancer Awareness Session for all the staff present there in Malayalam.
            </p>
            <p>
              To increase the understanding of the wide audience, we translated her prepared English presentation into Malayalam version presentation. This enabled the audience to understand the class better in their own native language.

            Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020, or nearly one in every six.<a href="#head4">[1]</a> Despite advancements in science revealing the complex interaction of variables responsible for malignant phenotypes,  successful treatments for most cancers are still a long way from reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Traditional cancer treatments rapidly kill growing cancer cells and normal cells. This leads to many adverse effects or even death in some cases. Targeted drugs represent an improvement over traditional therapies but have several flaws; for example, antibody-drug conjugates often cause great side effects; pathway inhibitor drugs rely on specific pathways, which sometimes can be bypassed by tumour cells.<a href="#head4">[2]</a></p>
          <p>
            As we learned of all these issues, we were determined to find a means to aid the millions of people suffering from cancer and its harsh treatment side effects. We began by learning how cancer medicines function and tried to get to the bottom of the issue. It was immediately apparent that present drug delivery systems were severely inadequate due to their unaffordable costs and off-site targeting. Therefore, we chose to build a more robust, affordable drug delivery system with improved specificity and efficacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            A group of 15 enthusiastic research students formed a group to seek and tackle the challenge of offsite targeting by leveraging the ability of synthetic biology to synergistically combine different approaches in cancer therapy. We started working extensively towards this goal, and eventually, it led to the creation of <strong>DUONCO</strong>, a novel dual nanovesicle drug delivery system that we believe has the potential to reduce off-site targeting. We hope to establish a new system to drug delivery that can be improved and adapted to better serve the needs of patients. To our knowledge, this is the first time such a dual nanovesicle system has been designed for targeted therapy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our next objective was to select a suitable model for our project. We went through the literature on current statistics of cancer rates in India and found out that breast cancer has become the most prevalent form of cancer, with the highest gross incidence and mortality. A few of our members also attended a medical camp held in our community, where they learned about the dramatic increase in breast cancer cases and their lack of knowledge of the diagnosis, causes, and treatments. This motivated us to select breast cancer as our model disease and move toward developing our drug delivery system.
          </p>
          <p>
            As our project progressed, we engaged with oncologists, doctors, and drug delivery specialists to finalise the components of our prototype. Our project modelling proved to be incredibly useful for comprehending the dynamics of OMV internalisation and augmenting our wet lab. While speaking with non-governmental organisations (Hair for Hope, Knitted Knockers), we observed the lack of knowledge and stigmas around breast cancer. This motivated us to organise talks and a drama to raise awareness, a breast cancer screening camp, a hair donation campaign, awareness pamphlets, and other outreach events. We also conducted a survey via online and offline platforms to analyse the awareness of the general public on breast cancer and related topics. This gave us insights on people's misconceptions (males cannot get breast cancer, breast cancer can cause pregnancy issues), and we made it a point to ensure that all of these issues were covered while preparing our outreach initiatives. Our meeting with companies and the government startup commission helped to get perspective on how to further our concept, and enabled us to build a suitable plan to introduce Duonco to the public in the best manner.

              The end users of our novel drug delivery method are the patients. Getting to know of their difficulties and expectations is essential. Cancer is a widely spoken topic. However, there are fewer discussed aspects of breast cancer. Less frequently discussed are the obstacles that patients face during therapy, including mental and physical frailty, societal pressure, and financial concerns. Therefore, we interviewed five individuals who had been cured of breast cancer. We obtained th <a data-modal-target="#modal1" class="button">here</a>.

            Barbara Demorest is the founder of Knitted Knockers Support Foundation. She is also a breast cancer survivor. We interacted with her to know more about her journey as well as the need for the knitted knockers. She faced several difficulties during her treatment days, always felt that her mental health often took a backseat to her physical well being. Her not being able to have reconstruction surgery or use a synthetic prosthetic really held her back from going back to life. <a data-modal-target="#modal2" class="button">Read more</a>

                Knitted Knockers was introduced to her through her doctor. Her friend later knitted knockers for her with the help of tutorial videos and finally she was able to gain a sense of freedom to go out, hug people and wear a normal bra without having to use any medical prosthetic device, this gave her a sense of normalcy. This was her inspiration to form KNITTED KNOCKERS. Several people who joined the initiative were able to relate to the shared trauma that they all faced.
                <br><br>
                First step towards forming this Non Profit Organisation was contacting her doctor and finding out the demand of knockers (50,000 mastectomies in a year - USA). Once the doctor gave them a number, the next step was to find resources in terms of the yarn and people to knit, so they could provide these knitted knockers for free. In 10 years, they've grown to having 1900 medical clinics registered with them and 60 international countries. Every month 10-12,000 knockers are being handed out. Her strategy for this was to raise awareness and get the local community there to involve and provide for their region. Knitters make the knockers and send it to their headquarters where they stuff them and post them to clinics.

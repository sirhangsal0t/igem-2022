        <h1 id="overview" style="color: #002147">Introduction</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Biosafety is the safe working practices associated with the handling of biological materials. It addresses the containment principles, methods, and procedures employed to prevent unintended exposure to diseases and poisons, as well as their inadvertent release. Responsible laboratory methods, including security, management, and accountability for critical biological materials, will aid in preventing unauthorised access and misappropriation of work. For iGEM 2022 our project aims to develop a bacterial nanovesicle-based drug delivery system for use in breast cancer. Several precautions have been adopted and are being strictly followed to guarantee the general safety of the project as well as of our fellow team members.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h1 id="lab" style="color: #002147">Laboratory Safety</h1>
        <br>
        <p>As decided by our team, we ensured that all the members attended thorough safety and security training, including handling bacterial cultures and disposal of contaminated materials before being allowed into the lab. Our institute’s biosafety officer Dr Poonam Thakur mentored us during the safety and security workshop, which covered topics of
          <ul>
            <li>Health and safety awareness</li>
            <li>Laboratory safety awareness</li>
            <li>Waste management</li>
          </ul>
          We scrupulously followed the general safety requirements, as well as the biology department safety guidelines. iGEM safety rules and policies were also followed while doing research activity in our lab.

        <h2>Lab Practices Followed</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Each and every one of the activities that take place in the laboratory are subject to stringent oversight and are only carried out after receiving the appropriate instruction from our chief investigator, lab assistants, and graduate students.</li>
            <li>All the team members were familiarised with the location and use of safety showers, fire extinguishers, eyewash stations, and fire alarms.</li>
            <li>All plates or cultures (bacterial and mammalian cell cultures) are sterilised with a 5% bleach solution, autoclaved and then finally burned. This process is repeated until the plates or cultures no longer contain any living cells.</li>
            <li>Before beginning any experiment in the laboratory, all of the participants are required to put on lab coats, masks, safety goggles, and nitrile gloves. This is to protect themselves from any potential hazards. </li>
            <li>Practise washing the hands with 70% ethanol before and after use of the lab to prevent contamination.</li>
            <li>Harmful substances like EtBr, are handled with the utmost caution throughout the procedure in accordance with the directions given to us by our lab instructors.</li>
            <li>Ensured all the waste generated were first properly sorted into the various colored bins that are stored in the laboratory before it can be removed from the facility and disposed of in an outside location.</li>
            <li>Proper lab notebook and reminder notes are maintained to help in keeping a check that one does not forget to follow the code of conduct in a lab.</li>

This tendency is extreme if the core is of unicorn. Old superstitions regarding wands rarely bear close examination, but I find that the old rhyme regarding rowan, chestnut, ash and hazel wands (rowan gossips, chestnut drones, ash is stubborn, hazel moans) contains a small nugget of truth. Those witches and wizards best suited to ash wands are not, in my experience, lightly swayed from their beliefs or purposes.

        <br>
        <h3>Aspen</h3>
        <br>
        <p id="Beech">Wand-quality aspen wood is white and fine-grained, and highly prized by all wand-makers for its stylish resemblance to ivory and its usually outstanding charmwork. The proper owner of the aspen wand is often an accomplished duellist, or destined to be so, for the aspen wand is one of those particularly suited to martial magic. An infamous and secretive eighteenth-century duelling club, which called itself The Silver Spears, was reputed to admit only those who owned aspen wands. In my experience, aspen wand owners are generally strong-minded and determined, more likely than most to be attracted by quests and new orders; this is a wand for revolutionaries.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Beech</h3>
        <br>
        <p id="Blackthorn">The true match for a beech wand will be, if young, wise beyond his or her years, and if full-grown, rich in understanding and experience. Beech wands perform very weakly for the narrow-minded and intolerant. Such wizards and witches, having obtained a beech wand without having been suitably matched (yet coveting this most desirable, richly hued and highly prized wand wood), have often presented themselves at the homes of learned wandmakers such as myself, demanding to know the reason for their handsome wand’s lack of power. When properly matched, the beech wand is capable of a subtlety and artistry rarely seen in any other wood, hence its lustrous reputation.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Blackthorn</h3>
        <br>
        Blackthorn, which is a very unusual wand wood, has the reputation, in my view well-merited, of being best suited to a warrior. This does not necessarily mean that its owner practises the Dark Arts (although it is undeniable that those who do so will enjoy the blackthorn wand’s prodigious power); one finds blackthorn wands among the Aurors as well as among the denizens of Azkaban. It is a curious feature of the blackthorn bush, which sports wicked thorns, that it produces its sweetest berries after the hardest frosts, and the wands made from this wood appear to need to pass through danger or hardship with their owners to become truly bonded. Given this condition, the blackthorn wand will become as loyal and faithful a servant as one could wish.

        <p>
          Cancer research is an ever-evolving field. Extensive efforts by countless researchers in the past have opened up diverse options for therapeutic intervention. However, a fundamental issue in drug therapy for cancer is that current chemotherapeutic drugs have poor specificity and indiscriminately affect cancerous and non-cancerous cells. Developing drugs that preferentially target tumour cells represents an open challenge in cancer therapy research that is of significant interest to biomedical researchers, patients, medical practitioners, and pharmaceutical companies. Although we are addressing the broader problem of improving the specificity of chemotherapy, we decided to use breast cancer as our model due to its importance to our local community
          <a id="head2"></a>
        </p>
        <br>

        <div>
          <h1 style="color: #002147">Inspiration</h1>
          <br>
          <p>
            Improving the specificity of chemotherapy is a longstanding problem relevant to all types of cancers, but we want to centre our project on breast cancer. On International Women's Day 2021, our team members volunteered for a breast cancer screening camp conducted in Chathancode, Kerala. We realised that even in our small community of Vithura (with a population of 20,000), the number of breast cancer cases was alarming. Soon after, we reached out to many people in Vithura. We spoke with two medical professionals who conduct screening and awareness initiatives among the local rural communities. Next, we met with five breast cancer survivors to talk about their experiences with chemotherapy. We interacted with the housekeeping staff at our institute to understand their awareness of breast cancer. Each of these interactions provided us with valuable insights into the impact breast cancer has on individuals and communities, but all of them affirmed our decision to focus on breast cancer research.

          <h1 style="color: #002147">Why Now?</h1>
          <br>
          <p>
            In 2020, there were 2.3 million new cases of breast cancer and 685,000 deaths globally. Currently, in India, breast cancer has the highest gross incidence and mortality among all cancers. Projections from the WHO Global Cancer Observatory suggest that by 2040, there could be 3.9 million new cases and 1.04 million deaths worldwide (Global Cancer Observatory, 2020). Socio-economic inequalities compound the issue in India by limiting access to life-saving diagnostics and treatment. Over 40% of households across India resort to distress funding to cover the cost of cancer treatment (Rajpal et al., 2018). As cases continue to rise, the next few years represent a crucial moment to change how we think about breast cancer therapy. As research moves towards optimising drug delivery systems, we believe our project fits with these shifting paradigms in cancer therapeutics and can have a meaningful impact on society.
          </p>
          <p>
            Breast cancer is emerging as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in India. Inaccessible health care facilities, lack of awareness, and the stigma associated with breast cancer have led to underdiagnosis and undertreatment. These issues are magnified in our local community of Vithura. In June 2022, we partnered with the Indian Medical Association to conduct a breast cancer screening camp for the housekeeping staff on our campus, who otherwise have limited access to advanced screening facilities. One in seven women screened using the iBreast screening device were suspected of breast cancer, which was much higher than the national average of one in twenty-nine women (Mathur et al., 2020). In Thiruvananthapuram, breast cancer had the highest incidence among all cancers and accounted for one-fourth of all new cancer cases in 2018-2019 (Annual Report 2018-19, RCC). Against this backdrop, we aim to develop an accessible and effective drug delivery system with enhanced specificity.

        <h1 id="subhead4.1" style="color: #002147">Project Description</h1>
        <br>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          We want to harness the power of synthetic biology to combine the different domains of cancer drug therapy- immunotherapy (in the form of immunostimulatory vesicles), chemotherapy (with the prodrug-enzyme system), and targeted cell therapy (using the marker-specific epitopes). Using engineering principles to design biological systems, we are developing a system for heterologous protein expression on bacterial OMVs. Our OMVs are engineered to display targeting epitopes that allow them to preferentially internalise into cancer cells overexpressing the target marker. This is further integrated with a prodrug-enzyme approach to build a dual-OMV system with enhanced specificity.

            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Though we are currently targeting breast cancer, the scope of the project is not limited to it. The modular design of Duonco allows it to be expanded to any kind of cancer by changing the relevant targeting epitopes on the surface of the OMVs. Cancers also vary among patients, and with the growing usage of genetic sequencing, patients' unique gene expression profiles can be used to modify the drug delivery system to tailor it to them. The potential use of Duonco in precision and targeted medicine makes it an attractive and valuable drug delivery system
        </p>
        <p>
          Duonco is a novel drug delivery system that can be tailored to specifically target any type of cancer. Much like an AND gate, Duonco employs a double-check mechanism by using two types of engineered vesicles that can target any two different receptors that are overexpressed in the target cell. In this way, only when both types of receptors are overexpressed in a cell (as in case of the cancerous cell we wish to target), can the engineered OMVs bind to these receptors and internalise within the target cell.
        </p>
        <br>
        <div class="row">

        <br>
        <p>
          These engineered vesicles can be made to carry various payloads such as drugs, siRNA, enzymes, etc. We decided to take pre-existing targeted cell therapy a step further by creating two different types of engineered vesicles, one loaded with a prodrug and the other with its corresponding enzyme. Each of the two sets of OMVs are engineered to overexpress an affinity protein that is characteristic of the type of cancer we wish to target.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this, we chose HER2-positive breast cancer as our model system.
          <a id="subhead4.2"></a>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Bacterial outer membrane vesicles</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          OMVs (Outer Membrane Vesicles) are nanosized proteoliposomes derived from the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. They are spherical buds filled with periplasmic content. They are principally used for pathogenesis, withstanding hostile conditions, and regulating microbial interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to their functional versatility, these vesicles have been adapted for use in bioengineering and synthetic biology. The composition of OMVs and their ability to deliver large biomolecules across complex cell envelopes make them effective drug carriers. A bioengineered OMV with low immunogenicity can target and deliver its payload to specific cells (in this case, tumour cells).
          <a id="subhead4.3"></a>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Engineering OMVs with affinity proteins</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          We engineered different E. coli knockouts to produce two types of OMVs with affinity proteins lodged on their surfaces: Affi-OMVs against the HER2 receptor and THP-OMVs against CX3CR1. Only on simultaneous internalisation into a HER2-positive breast cancer cell will the Affi-OMVs and THP-OMVs release the chosen prodrug and its corresponding enzyme, respectively. This would lead to the formation of an active drug that would endue a cytotoxic effect on the cell, therby triggering cell death.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Affibody</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          Affibodies are organic compounds that are antibody mimetics, although structurally dissimilar. Just like antibodies, they can bind to specific antigens with high affinity and selectivity. Their size and the ease with which they can be engineered make them particularly suitable for molecular recognition in diagnostics and therapeutics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Affibodies are delivered via OMVs to the target cells. For our project, HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) proteins have been chosen as the targets for the affibodies since they promote the growth of cancer cells and are therefore overexpressed.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Tumour Homing Peptide (THP)</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          Tumour Homing Peptides (THPs) are oligopeptides (from 5 to 30 amino acids in length) and bio-carriers of anti-tumour targeting agents, which affect the cells in vivo. THPs are highly suitable due to their low cytotoxicity toward non-neoplastic cells, lack of severe antigenicity, and the rate at which it easily permeates target cells. Their small size also allows them to be easily modified and repurposed. These tumour homing peptides are delivered in OMVs to the target cell. In our project, we use it to hone in on cells with CX3CR1 target receptors that are overexpressed in breast cancer cells.
          <a id="subhead4.4"></a>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Prodrug enzyme system</h2>
        <p>
          The prodrug/enzyme system is gaining popularity for cancer therapy because of its efficacy and specificity. A tumour homing peptide is attached to the enzyme in order to ensure that only cancerous cells uptake the enzyme. Inside the cancerous cell, the non-toxic prodrug is acted upon by the enzyme and converted into the active cytotoxic form of the drug. The drug induces tumour cell death and inhibits cancer progression. Normal cells do not have the enzyme and are left unaffected.
        </p>
        <p>
          In our project, the prodrug and enzyme are contained within OMVs, with the prodrug OMV being the Affi-OMV, specific for the HER2 receptor on breast cancer cells and the enzyme OMV, that is the THP-OMV, specific for the CX3CR1 receptor. The aforementioned double-check mechanism of dual vesicles ensures that only tumour cells are targeted.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prodrug/enzyme system could potentially make cancer therapy safer and more efficient by ensuring that cell death is induced only in tumour cells. Some popular examples include the gancyclovir/herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase, 5-fluorocytosine/cytosine deaminase, and nitrogen mustard/carboxypeptidase G2.
